# Book Store Project
This Book Management Application is a full-stack project built using React for the frontend and Express for the backend. It allows users to perform CRUD operationsâ€”add, edit, view, and delete booksâ€”with a sleek, responsive interface. Users can switch between table and card views to browse their collection. The app also implements real-time notifications for user actions using notistack, making for a smooth and engaging experience. Ideal for managing personal libraries or book inventories!
